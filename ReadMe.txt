Super Mario Odyssey Yoshi Star Kingdom

Info:
This is a Super Mario Odyssey custom kingdom replacing Cascade Kingdom. Contains 1 star,
10 green stars in the main kingdom, and 2 green stars in each of the six sub areas,
adding up to 23 stars to collect!

Installation:
The same as any other switch mod installation, place the romfs folder of the mod download
in this directory on your SD card:

/atmosphere/contents/0100000000010000/romfs

If you don't have your switch modded, this won't work. My discord server won't help you mod
your switch, please look elsewhere for this information. If it still doesn't work, join
the discord and people can help! https://discord.gg/EnaKHEg
